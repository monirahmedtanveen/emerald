##### Introduction

Sometimes applications require some task to be run periodically on the server. It can be sending push notification, trashing unwanted data from database, creating backups etc. This can be done easily using cron job in laravel. This project has the code to send email using scheduler of laravel.

##### Cron

Cron is a time-based task scheduler in Unix/Linux operating systems. It executes shell commands at a pre-specified time period. Cron uses a configuration file known as Crontab to handle the task scheduling process.

Crontab contains all the Cron jobs related to a specific task. Cron jobs are composed of two parts, the Cron expression, and a shell command that needs to be run.
