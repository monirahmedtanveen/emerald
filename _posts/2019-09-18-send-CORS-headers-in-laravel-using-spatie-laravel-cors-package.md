##### Introduction

This is an application which have laravel backend and jQuery frontend. In this application I solved the CORS(Cross Origin Resource Sharing) headers error while sharing data between frontend and backend. I used <a href="https://github.com/spatie/laravel-cors">spatie/laravel-cors</a> Package in backend app to solve the CORS headers issue.
