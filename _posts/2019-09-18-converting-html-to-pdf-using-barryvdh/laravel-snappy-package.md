##### Introduction

Laravel Snappy package uses <a href="https://wkhtmltopdf.org/" target="_black">Wkhtmltopdf</a> to convert html to pdf. The performance of this package is way better then some other pdf generating library which is wriiten in php like :- dompdf, mpdf, tcpdf etc. As laravel snappy uses <a href="https://wkhtmltopdf.org/" target="_black">Wkhtmltopdf</a>, it can generate pdf of large amount of data withing a very short time. On the other hand, dompdf, mpdf and tcpdf fails dealing with large amount of data.
